# BulletHell--Celeritas
Game Pitch
Arsene, a space fighter from Earth is the strongest and the fastest pilot in the universe. The ship he uses is called Celeritas and it’s unmatched by any ship or space carrier. One day, coming back from visiting his girlfriend from another galaxy, he notices hundreds, if not thousands of spaceships heading towards Earth. He also notices that these ships are equipped with powerful weapons. You quickly realize that this group isn’t here to say  hello, but to launch a full scale invasion of Earth. Calculating their travel speed, you determined that they will arrive at earth in 14 hours.
You have the fastest ship in the universe, so you were easily able to catch up to them and pass ahead of them. You quickly head back to Earth in 7 hours and tell the leader of Earth what you saw and he says there isn’t enough time to mobilize a response earth just sent most of their military to assist another planet in war. Arsene couldn’t accept defeat like that because not only is he a warrior, he is also has to protect his family on Earth and be there for his unborn child in another galaxy.
Arsene decided he is going to take on this fleet by himself. He will not let even one ship go past him, otherwise it will be the end of earth. With fire in his eyes Arsene, gets on Celeritas and intercepts the invasion.
